# ClarionC-Blue
Clarion C-Bus interface made with arduino to spoof CD changer. Targeted use is for bluetooth, could also be simplified and used for AUX IN.

### Support

Testing and initial application being done in a 1995 Saab 900 S with stock head unit and existing CD changer wiring. Will work with any new generation Saab 900 from 1994 to 1998 (Excluding 1994 convertible).

Theory indicates that this unit, when assembled, will work with any Clarion made stereo using the 13 pin DIN connector. I do not have the ability to test with any other units. The only unit available to me, and the only unit I target, is the factory Clarion unit installed in my Saab 900.

### Documentation

This document was incredibly insightful in regards to the protocols Clarion is using to communicate between the head and changer.

### Components
Component list will be published when a prototype has been built.
